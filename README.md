To remove the `## **` markdown syntax from all titles and increase the title size, we can use HTML tags to format the titles and remove the markdown syntax for headings (`#`, `##`, etc.). To make the titles bigger, you can use the `<h1>` tag for the main title, and adjust other headings accordingly.

Here's the updated README without `## **` and with larger title formatting:

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <h1>🟢 Stock Management System</h1>
</p>
